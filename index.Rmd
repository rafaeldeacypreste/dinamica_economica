### Colourizing text

This is a function from [R Markdwon Cookbook](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/font-color.html) to colourize text:

```{r}
colorize <- function(x, color) {
  if (knitr::is_latex_output()) {
    sprintf("\\textcolor{%s}{%s}", color, x)
  } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) {
    sprintf("<span style='color: %s;'>%s</span>", color,
            x)
  } else
    x
}
```
